# Welcome to Lightfast MCP

Lightfast MCP builds, maintains, and ships reliable Model Context Protocols (MCPs) for creative applications. We connect AI models to tools like Blender, TouchDesigner, Ableton, Adobe Creative Suite, Unreal Engine, and more through a simple, consistent architecture.

## What is Model Context Protocol?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables AI models to understand and interact with creative applications. This allows for:

- AI-assisted creative workflows
- Prompt-based manipulation of application elements
- Automation of repetitive tasks
- Intelligent exploration of creative possibilities

## Protocol Compliance

Lightfast MCP strictly adheres to the official [Model Context Protocol specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). We follow all standards and best practices defined by the specification to ensure compatibility and interoperability.

If you're new to MCP or want to understand its architecture in more depth, we recommend exploring the official MCP documentation.

## Open Source and Community-Driven

Lightfast MCP Repository is MIT-licensed and welcomes contributions from the community. Whether you want to add support for new applications, improve existing implementations, or enhance documentation, your help is appreciated!
