## Claude Desktop Configuration

### Configure Claude Desktop

To use Claude with Lightfast MCP, you need to configure Claude Desktop:

1. Open or create the file at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (on macOS) or the equivalent path on your operating system.

2. Add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lightfast-blender": {
      "command": "/path/to/your/python",
      "args": [
        "-m",
        "lightfast_mcp.servers.blender_mcp_server"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

3. Replace `/path/to/your/python` with the path to your Python interpreter (typically the one in your virtual environment where Lightfast MCP is installed).

For example:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lightfast-blender": {
      "command": "/Users/username/Code/lightfast-mcp/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": [
        "-m",
        "lightfast_mcp.servers.blender_mcp_server"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

4. Restart Claude Desktop and select the "lightfast-blender" MCP server from the Claude settings.

## Testing the Connection

### Start Blender and Claude

1. Open Blender and enable the Lightfast MCP server from the sidebar panel
2. Start Claude Desktop and select the "lightfast-blender" MCP server
3. Claude should now be able to control Blender through the MCP connection

Try asking Claude to create a simple object in Blender, like: "Create a red cube in Blender"

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- Ensure Blender is running with the addon enabled
- Check that the MCP server shows as "Server active" in the Blender panel
- Verify that no firewall is blocking the connection on ports 9876 or 9877
- Restart both Blender and Claude Desktop if necessary

For more detailed troubleshooting, check the console outputs in both Blender and Claude Desktop.
