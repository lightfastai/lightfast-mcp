# Lightfast MCP

## What is Lightfast MCP?

Lightfast MCP connects your favorite creative applications (like Blender, TouchDesigner, Adobe Creative Suite, etc.) to AI models through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This allows AI to directly interact with and control these applications, enabling prompt-assisted creation, manipulation, and automation.

Think of Lightfast MCP as a bridge between AI language models and creative software. Just as MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools, Lightfast MCP extends this capability specifically for creative applications.

## Why Lightfast MCP?

Lightfast MCP helps you:

- **Connect AI to creative tools**: Directly integrate AI models with applications like Blender
- **Automate creative workflows**: Let AI assist with repetitive tasks in your creative process
- **Explore new creative possibilities**: Enable AI to help with ideation and execution in your creative projects
- **Maintain a consistent workflow**: Use the same MCP protocol you might already be familiar with

## Architecture

The protocol follows a client-server architecture where AI systems can connect to and control multiple creative applications:

This architecture enables:

- **Client to MCP Server**: AI models and tools connect directly to Lightfast MCP Servers
- **MCP Server to Applications**: Each server connects via socket to application-specific addons/plugins
- **Cross-Application Control**: Control multiple creative applications from a single AI system
- **Remote Services Access**: MCP Servers can connect to external services through HTTP APIs
- **Intelligent Interaction**: AI models can understand application state, make decisions, and take actions through code execution

## Next Steps

Now that you understand what Lightfast MCP is and how it works, here's how to get started:

1. **Install Lightfast MCP**: Follow the [Installation Guide](/docs/installation) to set up the software and dependencies

2. **Configure your applications**:
   - [Blender Setup](/docs/blender)
   - TouchDesigner (coming soon)
   - Adobe Suite (coming soon)

3. **Start creating**: Once you've set up Lightfast MCP with your preferred application, you can:
   - Explore the examples in the documentation
   - Join our community to share your creations
   - Contribute to the project by adding support for more applications
