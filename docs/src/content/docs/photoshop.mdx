## Claude Desktop Configuration

### Configure Claude Desktop

To use Claude with Lightfast MCP, you need to configure Claude Desktop:

1. Open or create the file at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (on macOS) or the equivalent path on your operating system.

2. Add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lightfast-photoshop": {
      "command": "/path/to/your/python",
      "args": [
        "-m",
        "lightfast_mcp.servers.photoshop_mcp_server"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

3. Replace `/path/to/your/python` with the path to your Python interpreter (typically the one in your virtual environment where Lightfast MCP is installed).

For example:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lightfast-photoshop": {
      "command": "/Users/username/Code/lightfast-mcp/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": [
        "-m",
        "lightfast_mcp.servers.photoshop_mcp_server"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

4. Restart Claude Desktop and select the "lightfast-photoshop" MCP server from the Claude settings.

## Testing the Connection

### Start Photoshop and Claude

1. Open Photoshop and connect to the Lightfast MCP server using the plugin panel
2. Start Claude Desktop and select the "lightfast-photoshop" MCP server
3. Claude should now be able to control Photoshop through the MCP connection

Try asking Claude to perform a simple operation in Photoshop, like: "Create a new document in Photoshop"

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- Ensure Photoshop is running with the plugin loaded
- Check that the plugin shows "Connected" status in the plugin panel
- Verify that no firewall is blocking the connection on port 8765
- Restart both Photoshop and Claude Desktop if necessary
- Check the log section in the plugin panel for detailed error messages

For more detailed troubleshooting, check the console outputs in both Photoshop and Claude Desktop.
