# Installation

Follow these steps to get Lightfast MCP up and running with Blender.

## Python Package Installation

First, install the Lightfast MCP Python package:

```bash
# Using uv (recommended)
uv pip install lightfast-mcp

# Or using pip
pip install lightfast-mcp
```

## Blender Addon Installation

1. Download the latest Blender addon from our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lightfastai/lightfast-mcp/releases)

2. Open Blender and navigate to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons

3. Click "Install..." and select the downloaded `lightfast_blender_addon.py` file

4. Enable the addon by checking the box next to "Lightfast Blender MCP Addon"

## Starting the MCP Server

To start the Lightfast MCP server:

```bash
# From Python
from lightfast_mcp.servers.blender_mcp_server import mcp
mcp.run()

# Or from the command line
python -m lightfast_mcp.servers.blender_mcp_server
```

## Verifying Connection

1. In Blender, go to the "Lightfast MCP" panel in the sidebar
2. Click "Start MCP Server" to start the Blender socket server
3. The server should show "Server active on port 9876"
4. Your Claude client or other MCP-compatible application can now connect to Blender

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

If you're having trouble connecting:

1. Make sure Blender is running and the addon is enabled
2. Check that the MCP server is running (you should see logs in the terminal)
3. Verify that port 9876 is not blocked by a firewall
4. Try restarting both the MCP server and Blender
