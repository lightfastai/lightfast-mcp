# MCP Core Concepts

This is **lightfast-mcp**, a Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation for creative applications like Blender. Remember these key concepts:

## MCP Protocol Fundamentals
- **MCP Server**: Exposes tools and resources through standardized protocol (this project implements servers)
- **MCP Client**: Connects to servers to use tools (AI models use clients)
- **Transport Types**: `stdio` (local subprocess) or `sse` (HTTP Server-Sent Events)
- **Tools**: Functions that can be called by AI models with `@mcp.tool()` decorator
- **Resources**: Data sources that can be read by AI models with `@mcp.resource()` decorator
- **Prompts**: Reusable prompt templates with parameters

## Project Context
- We implement MCP servers for creative applications
- FastMCP library provides the `@mcp.tool()` and `@mcp.resource()` decorators
- All servers inherit from `BaseServer` and use `ServerConfig`
- Support both `stdio` and `streamable-http` transports
- Configuration-driven design using YAML/JSON config files
