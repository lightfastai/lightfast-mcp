# lightfast-mcp - MCP Server Implementations for Creative Applications

**Production-ready MCP server implementations for creative applications** - Control Blender and other creative tools through the Model Context Protocol.

Lightfast MCP provides reliable, well-tested MCP server implementations for creative applications, with optional management and AI client tools.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core MCP Servers

- **ðŸŽ¨ Blender MCP Server**: Control Blender through MCP protocol for 3D modeling, animation, and rendering
- **ðŸ§ª Mock MCP Server**: Testing and development server for MCP protocol validation

## ðŸ”§ Optional Features

- **Multi-Server Orchestration**: Run and coordinate multiple MCP servers simultaneously
- **AI Integration**: Built-in AI tools for testing and interacting with servers  
- **Configuration-Driven**: YAML/JSON configuration for easy server management
- **Flexible Transport**: Support for both stdio and HTTP-based transports

## Protocol Compliance

Lightfast MCP strictly adheres to the official [Model Context Protocol specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction). This ensures compatibility with all MCP clients and provides a standardized way for AI models to interact with creative applications.

For more information about the Model Context Protocol, including core concepts, resources, prompts, tools, and sampling, please refer to the [official MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction).
